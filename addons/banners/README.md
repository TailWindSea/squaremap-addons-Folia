# squaremap-banners

squaremap-banners is an addon to squaremap that allows players to display their banners the same way you can see banners on the vanilla map. Players with the `squaremap.banners.admin` permission need to shift right-click with an open map in their main hand on a placed banner to make it visible. Shift left-clicking will make the banner disappear from the map.
